- Hi, I’m liu ruimeng, a student struggling in the sea of learning;
- I am currently a reserve graduate student in computer science and technology who are interested in deep learning which are widely used in cv and nlp. 
- Recently, I have been obsessed with trying to build an automatic image labeling system using object detection networks and multi-modal models under few-shot learning conditions. This is a interdisciplinary project which is full of challenging, and I just took the first hard step. The functions taht automatic generation of object detection and classification of data sets, a set of automatic tagging cycle strategy based on active learning, as well as the texture classification and zero defect detection, few-shot (body/facial emotion recognition application have been achieved. In the future, I am eager to go deep into the source of the network structure, to solve more real difficulties faced by the industry, and achieve the product landing as far as possible.
- I’m looking to collaborate on ...well, I need to improve my abilities first >-<;
- How to reach me? Well, This is my Email address: lrm1844520476@gmail.com. ^-^
